         <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
         <p>As everything is on internet and the cloud our information on wrong hand is a biggest threat to us.
            We are here to help you with your cyber security needs.Read from us listen us or reach us we are avilable in

         <h4>Cyber Security</h4><br>
         <p>So what is this Cyber security?</br>
            It's about protecting yourself against threats that can be used by hackers to steal data, control systems,
            and even take over entire
            system. It is like locking your things up and we can teach how to do and mannage it. Data is not like a
            bunch of gold and cash in your locker
            if they are lost you are aware of it but when you loose data you never know it was stolen as it can be
            copied letting the orignal stay as nothing hapened.

         <h4>Hackers</h4><br>
         <p>Who are these hackers? Whenever we mention the words 'cybercrime' or 'cybersecurity,' a name that pops up is
            'hackers'.
            Hackers are individuals highly trained in computer networking who may intervene in any system for either
            good or bad purposes, such as stealing data, crashing a system, or making money.
            Hackers are of various types: White Hat/Ethical Hackers, Black Hat Hackers, Gray Hat Hackers, Script
            Kiddies, Green Hat Hackers, Blue Hat Hackers, Red Hat Hackers, and State/Nation-Sponsored Hackers. We will
            focus on the most important ones here.</p>
         <br>

         <br><br>
         <p>White hat / Ethical hackers<br><br>
            White hat hackers are like good computer detectives. They use their skills to find and fix problems in
            computers and websites to help make them safe from bad people who might want to do harm. They are the "good
            guys" of the computer world.
            <br><br>Black hat hackers<br><br>
            Black hat hackers are like the "bad guys" of the computer world. They use their computer skills to do things
            that are not allowed or hurtful, like stealing information or causing problems on the internet.
            <br><br>Script Kiddies<br><br>
            Script Kiddies are like children who don't really understand how to build or fix things themselves, but they
            use tools and instructions made by others to do things on computers. Sometimes they use these tools to do
            bad things, like causing problems on the computer or stealing things, without really knowing how it all
            works.
            <br><br>State or nation-sponsored hackers <br><br>
            State or nation-sponsored hackers are like secret agents who work for a whole country, and their job is to
            use computers to gather information or do things online that their country wants, like spying or protecting
            it from other countries. They are like computer soldiers for a country, and they use their computer skills
            to help their country, but sometimes they can also do bad things to other countries.

         Cybercrime is a significant and evolving problem in the digital age, and law enforcement agencies,
         cybersecurity professionals, and individuals must work together to combat it and protect against its various
         forms.
         <br><br>
         So we learned who are good hackers bad hackers types and everything
         now the main thing is how will we protect outselves?
         Protecting yourself from cybercrime and cybercriminals requires a combination of proactive measures and
         responsible online behavior. Here are some key steps to help enhance your cybersecurity:

         - Consider using a reputable password manager to generate and store passwords securely as easy passwords are a
         piece of old tackle fpr the hackers and algorithms.
         <br><br>
         2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):<br><br>
         - Whenever possible, enable MFA for your accounts to add an extra layer of security.
         or else we never know we might be connected to a clone wifi and sharing our data.
         <br><br>
         3. Keep Software Updated:<br><br>
         - Regularly update your operating system, software, and applications to patch known vulnerabilities.
         <br><br>
         4. Beware of Phishing:<br><br>
         - Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or links, especially from unknown sources.

         <br><br>
         5. Use Secure Wi-Fi:<br><br>
         - Secure your home Wi-Fi network with a strong password and encryption (WPA3).
         - Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities unless you use a VPN (Virtual Private Network).
         <br><br>
