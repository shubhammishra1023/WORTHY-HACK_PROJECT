Cyber Security 
so what is it actually?
It's about protecting yourself against threats that can be used by hackers to steal data, control systems, and even take over entire systems. It's like locking your things up, and we can teach you how to do and manage it. Data is not like a bunch of gold and cash in your locker. If they are lost, you are aware of it, but when you lose data, you never know it was stolen, as it can be copied, leaving the original as if nothing happened.

Hackers
Here are the corrected sentences:

Who are these hackers? Whenever we mention the words 'cybercrime' or 'cybersecurity,' a name that pops up is 'hackers'.
Hackers are individuals highly trained in computer networking who may intervene in any system for either good or bad purposes, such as stealing data, crashing a system, or making money.
Hackers are of various types: White Hat/Ethical Hackers, Black Hat Hackers, Gray Hat Hackers, Script Kiddies, Green Hat Hackers, Blue Hat Hackers, Red Hat Hackers, and State/Nation-Sponsored Hackers. We will focus on the most important ones here.

*note:using list tag.
White hat / Ethical hackers
White hat hackers are like good computer detectives. They use their skills to find and fix problems in computers and websites to help make them safe from bad people who might want to do harm. They are the "good guys" of the computer world.

Black hat hackers
 Black hat hackers are like the "bad guys" of the computer world. They use their computer skills to do things that are not allowed or hurtful, like stealing information or causing problems on the internet.

Script Kiddies 
Script Kiddies are like children who don't really understand how to build or fix things themselves, but they use tools and instructions made by others to do things on computers. Sometimes they use these tools to do bad things, like causing problems on the computer or stealing things, without really knowing how it all works.

State or nation-sponsored hackers 
State or nation-sponsored hackers are like secret agents who work for a whole country, and their job is to use computers to gather information or do things online that their country wants, like spying or protecting it from other countries. They are like computer soldiers for a country, and they use their computer skills to help their country, but sometimes they can also do bad things to other countries.

Cyber Crime
Cybercrime is like a bad activity that happens on the internet or using computers. It's when people or groups use computers to do illegal things, like stealing personal information, money, or data from others, spreading viruses, hacking into computer systems, or doing other harmful stuff online. Just like there are rules and laws in the real world, there are rules and laws in the online world too, and cybercrime is when someone breaks those rules and does something wrong using technology.
